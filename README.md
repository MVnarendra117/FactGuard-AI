## 🚨 The Motive

In an age where synthetic media and misinformation spread faster than truth, **FactGuard AI** serves as a digital shield. Our mission is to restore trust in information by providing accessible, military-grade forensic tools to the public. We leverage cutting-edge AI to detect deepfakes, verify news claims, and expose manipulation in real-time.

## 🌟 Features

### 📝 Text & News Verification

- **Real-time Fact-Checking**: Instantly cross-references claims against a live index of trusted global sources (Reuters, AP, BBC, etc.).
- **Consensus Analysis**: Evaluates the agreement level across multiple reporting agencies.
- **Bias & Manipulation Detection**: Identifies emotionally charged language and potential propaganda techniques.

### 🖼️ Image Forensics

- **Deepfake Detection**: Analyzes pixel-level artifacts to identify AI-generated imagery (Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion).
- **Manipulation Analysis**: Detects Photoshop edits, warping, and inconsistent lighting/shadows.
- **Metadata Scanning**: Checks for digital signatures and generation markers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (with custom glassmorphism UI)
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (Multimodal capabilities)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Charts**: Recharts

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- A Google Gemini API Key

## 🛡️ Disclaimer

FactGuard AI uses probabilistic models to analyze content. While highly accurate, no forensic tool is 100% perfect. Results should be used as a strong indicator but not absolute proof. Always verify critical information through multiple human-verified channels.
